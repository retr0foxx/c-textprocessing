# c-textprocessing
Small and bad "text processing" library for C

Currently only has a text reader

I just realized that if I want to make a text writer and text reader it'd be weird to have them be seperated so they're probably gonna be combined to 1 now so there'll be a major change later

Also because its gonna be combined this whole thinge is probably only gonna be like 2 files which isn't really worthy for like cmake and stuff but I'll just consider it as cmake and git practice since I've never actually really used them.
